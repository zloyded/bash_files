# Bash files

This is my bash files Project for Linux. It also works on Mac OS X with a few minor limitations. The project grew out of the tweaks and additions I applied for my personal use.

Some inspiration was taken from projects such as [oh-my-zsh
](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/lib), [bash-it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it) and others.

`Bash files` is a work in progress project, everything is still a bit quick and dirty and constantly moving. I hope you enjoy it nevertheless.

Feel free to contribute, reuse, clone, etc.

### Initial installation procedure

Clone the repository into your home directory, it will create the `.bash_files` subdirectory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/binaryanomaly/bash_files ~/.bash_files
```


#### Invoke init file from .bash_profile

Add the following to the end of your `.bash_profile` in your home directory:

```bash
# .bash_files initialization
if [ -f ~/.bash_files/init.sh ]; then
    . ~/.bash_files/init.sh
fi
```

We put this in `.profile` and not .bashrc because we only want it to be executed when bash is executed i.e. a user is logging in - aka login shell.

#### Dependencies

The following Standard Linux commands are needed:

- `dig` to determine the public ip via opendns
- `free` for ram info
- `df` for diskspace info
- `last` for last logins
- `whatis` for command related infos


#### Optional dependencies

The following optional packages are recommended to be installed:

- `figlet` for big ascii letter hostname
- `lolcat` to colorize the ascii letter hostname

Install them using apt (Linux) or homebrew (Mac)

The script will autodetect if each of those is installed and disable the features if not found.
